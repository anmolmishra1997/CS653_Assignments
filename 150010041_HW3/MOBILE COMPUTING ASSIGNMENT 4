Sensors Use For Accelerometer and GPS
Shared Preferences Storage for Activities
Permanent Storage in CSV files.


1. User Information needs to be stored in Shared Preferences -
    during change of orientation, app navigation and app closure.
    Create shared preferences for each activity.

2. Check all registration fields are filled. Store user information in shared preferences.
    Make record screen the main activity.

3. ASK SIR about the ONE ACTIVTIY WITH FRAGMENT PART.

4. In the recording activity, get the label from the user each time he starts recording.
  Create a file for each recording, and start a service to store data in CSV file.

5. Integrate sensors in app. Implement service for running the app in background



Modify HW 2 to do the following
- Persistence of user information and sensor selection even during change of orientation, app navigation, and app closure
- Check that all the fields in the registration are filled in
- Action bar contains tabs instead of a spinner and an icon
- One activity with each tab implemented as a fragment
- In the activity for recording, get from the user label (stationary or walking) of that activity
- Save sensor data in CSV files
- The CSV file contains
0th row {first name, last name, mobile, email, gender, age}
1st row {timestamp, lat, long, accelx, accely, accelz, label}
2nd row onwards contain values as per the format in the 1st row
- One file for each recording, stored in the data folder of your app
- Files should be exportable to PC
- The app should keep collecting data even though the app in not in the foreground (collect data in a background service as a thread)
